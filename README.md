This repository contains examples and ready-to-use implementations of Galileo clients for different service to easily start
an experiment.

The project mainly depends on the [galileo-experiments](https://github.com/edgerun/galileo-experiments-extensions) repository
and should help newcomers to understand the project with ready to go examples!

# Instructions
